              Our story
            </h2>
            <p className="measure text-lg leading-relaxed text-ink">
              The firm was founded in April 2022 with a simple but enduring idea: legal problems
              should not have to become overwhelming before people seek professional help, and
              quality legal representation should be both effective and reassuring.
            </p>
            <p className="measure mt-5 leading-relaxed text-ink-soft">
              The name Assuage — meaning to ease, relieve or lessen a burden — reflects the
              philosophy upon which the firm was established: to provide sound legal solutions while
              making the legal process clearer, more manageable and less burdensome for our clients.
            </p>
            <p className="measure mt-5 leading-relaxed text-ink-soft">
              From our foundation, we have been committed to building a practice anchored on
              integrity, excellence, diligence, effectiveness and genuine client service. We
              understand that behind every legal matter is a person, family, business, investment or
              aspiration that matters deeply to someone. Consequently, we approach every brief as an
              opportunity to protect the interests of our clients and to provide a practical
              strategy for achieving their objectives.
